Quick one today. You are doing TDD and it is fun and it feels right. Know how to do better End each daywork session by writing failing test to the next thing you wanted to write. When you will be back to your code next time you will immediately know what you were doing, what you planned to do next and you will start right away. This is pretty good solution to the problem of looking through the code, source control history logs etc. to figure out where you left last time. Works for me!
