While I'm having fun with `CoffeeScript` those last few days, to try it out I'm creating plain old `HTML` pages sometimes. Just a simple, messy html to see how script behaves in browser. Of course to do that script must be either part of `html` file itself or included into it using `script` tag. Simple enough, done that like hundred times over the last few years.

But apparently doing something many times does not mean you will do it correctly next time. Or you will know how to do it correctly. An hour ago I would not be able to tell what's wrong with this file:

Seems correct, doesn't it? All tags closed, all tags present. Sure - that's not the nicest `html` you will see, but should do the job. Yet, there is small, but serious issue that will cause `JavaScript` code not to be executed. It's the self closing `script` tag.
This StackOverflow discussion gives detailed answer to the problem: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/69913/why-dont-self-closing-script-tags-work" title="Why don't self-closing script tags work?" target="_blank">Why don't self-closing script tags work?</a>.
But just to sum it up - you will either need to explicitly mark that your document's MIME type is `application/xhtml+xml` or use explicit closing in `script` tag. This is because browsers interpret tags in some way that causes them to generate content different than expected. For example, the above code could end up with `html` looking like:
[gist]https://gist.github.com/pako1337/5331801[/gist]
The alert is out of the `script` section, causing it to be interpreted as normal `html` which is rubbish.

So this was a good day - learnt something new. Hope you learnt something too!
