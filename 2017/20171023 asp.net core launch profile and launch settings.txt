How to start application in ASP.NET Core from command line?

How to start application in ASP.NET Core in development mode?

```
set ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development
dotnet run
```

How to make it one command? Use launch profile, available in `dotnet run` command. But to make it work, there needs to be `launchSettings.json` file with profile definition, i.e. what needs to be done for application to run.

Definition I am using, inspired by web, is this:

```javascript
{
    "iisSettings": {
        "windowsAuthentication": false,
        "anonymousAuthentication": true,
        "iisExpress": {
        "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:5000/",
        "sslPort": 0
        }
    },
    "profiles": {
        "Dev": {
            "commandName": "Project",
            "launchBrowser": true,
            "launchUrl": "http://localhost:5000",
            "environmentVariables": {
                "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

And to launch it in Dev mode all I have to do is:

```
dotnet run --launch-profile 'Dev'
```

And... it fails, saying it cannot find this profile. That is because what I did is place the file next to `.csproj` file. Seemed obvious. Well, it should not. Where this file needs to be is in Properties directory (`\Properties\launchSettings.json`). With this layout - it works perfectly fine.
