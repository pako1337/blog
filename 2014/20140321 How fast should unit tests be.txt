Well, fast. Damn fast, if you ask me. I have ~630 unit tests running in somewhere around 90 seconds. You can't even imagine how slow it feels when you are trying to run them frequently. But when build time alone takes about 6 minutes, how fast your ut runs is negligible :(

And then there comes Greg Young with his idea of fast unit tests:

So I will keep trying to get to that level in my project. Hopefully so are you.
